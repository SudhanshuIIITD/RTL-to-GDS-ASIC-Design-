# RTL-to-GDS-ASIC-Design-
â€¢ A synchronous design consists of a Counter, Encoder, and XOR and is carried Forward through the following steps:- RTL design, Test-bench design, Coverage analysis, Logic Synthesis, Equivalence checking, Static timing Analysis, DFT insertion, Floor and Power Planning, Placement, CTS (Clock Tree synthesis), using Cadence design tools.
